                delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to

                Verification process</p>
            <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom
                we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so
                that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
                request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide
                with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or
                email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances
                dictate.</p>
            <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the
                request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
                verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
                request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
                fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
                you.</p>
